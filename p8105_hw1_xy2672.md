## Problem 1：

Packages already installed in console, now loading data:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

### Dataset description:

The variables included in the dataset are:  
`origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour`.  
The early january weather dataset has **358** rows and **15** columns.  
The mean temperature of the early january weather is **39.58**.

Now creating the scatterplot of temperature vs. time_hour:

``` r
weather_scatterplot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

The scatterplot repeatedly shows a daily cycle. Based on the
scatterplot, it is clear that the temperature generally increases from
Jan 1 to Jan 14. In addition, temperature tends to be higher at the
noon, and lower at night. Observations from nighttime and early morning
are generally more humid than those around noon as shown in the
scatterplot.

Saving the scatterplot:

``` r
ggsave("Weather_scatterplot.png", plot = weather_scatterplot)
```

## Problem 2:

Set seed for reproducibility

``` r
set.seed(1234)
```

Creating the dataframe:

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_num = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical_gt0 = vec_num > 0,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","x","y","z"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red","red","red","green","green","green","green","blue","blue","blue"))
)
```

Now taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe just created:

``` r
  num_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, vec_num))
  logical_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, vec_logical_gt0))
  char_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
  factor_mean = mean(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

Based on the warning message, it is clear that calculating mean for
`vec_num` and `vec_logical_gt0` work and `vec_char` and `vec_factor` do
not work.

Changing the other three variables to numeric:

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_logical_gt0))   
  as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

Based on the numeric converting, vec_logical and vec_factor are
successfully converted to numeric, but vec_char does not.  
Since in vec_logical, FALSE = 0 and TRUE = 1, this explains why mean()
works on logical vectors.  
In vec_char, NAs is returned because the characters cannot be converted
to numbers, so mean() cannot work.  
In vec_factor, even though it is successfully converted, the numbers
represent different levels, which are categories instead of meaningful
numbers, so mean() does not work.

This means that R can calculate mean of numeric and logical vectors but
not char and factor.
