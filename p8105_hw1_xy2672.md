## Problem 1：

Packages already installed in console, now loading data:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

### Dataset description:

The variables included in the dataset are:  
`origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour`.  
The early january weather dataset has **358** rows and **15** columns.  
The mean temperature of the early january weather is **39.58**.

Now creating the scatterplot of temperature vs. time_hour:

``` r
weather_scatterplot = ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

The scatterplot repeatedly shows a daily cycle. Based on the
scatterplot, it is clear that the temperature generally increases from
Jan 1 to Jan 14. In addition, temperature tends to be higher at the
noon, and lower at night. Observations from nighttime and early morning
are generally more humid than those around noon as shown in the
scatterplot.

Saving the scatterplot:

``` r
ggsave("Weather_scatterplot.png", plot = weather_scatterplot)
```

## Problem 2:

Set seed for reproducibility

``` r
set.seed(1234)
```

Creating the dataframe:

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_num = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical_gt0 = vec_num > 0,
  vec_char = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","x","y","z"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red","red","red","green","green","green","green","blue","blue","blue"))
)
```
