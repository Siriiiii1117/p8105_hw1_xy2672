## Problem 1ï¼š

Packages already installed in console, now loading data:

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

The early january weather dataset has **`r nrow(early_january_weather)`** rows and **`r ncol(early_january_weather)`** columns.
The variables included in the dataset are: ``r names(early_january_weather)``. The mean temperature of the early january weather is **`r round(mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp)), 2)`**.
